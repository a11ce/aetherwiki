        <p>An <strong>aeromechanic vehicle</strong> (also called
<strong>aeromech</strong>, <strong>mech</strong>, or
<strong>Schreitfahrzeug</strong>) is a pulse-driven legged vehicle
powered by compressed aether. Aeromechs use discrete pulses controlled
by direct mechanical pressure latches to extend and retract linear
joints. This makes them reliable in adverse environments, and allowed
them to be much smaller than contemporary (pre-<a href="crp.html"
class="wikilink">CRP</a>) wheeled or tracked vehicles.</p>
<p>Aeromechs were developed by <a href="greyhound.html"
class="wikilink">Greyhound</a> during the 470s. The first model
produced, designated ASfz-7E, was intended to be sold to Ercos in 477
for border patrol outside the Whitewall. During trials, it was
discovered that positively-pressurized aeromechs protected against
locust attack, so the order was taken over by <a href="goldwind.html"
class="wikilink">Goldwind</a> with financial backing from <a
href="ipro.html" class="wikilink">IPRO</a>. Some ASfz-7Es were later
transferred to <a href="coachguard-nord.html"
class="wikilink">Coachguard-Nord</a> and the rest were seized by Pax
authorities in connection with the <a href="crane-affair.html"
class="wikilink">Crane Affair</a>.</p>
<p>ASfz-7Es have four legs and carry a crew of three: pilot, engineer,
and commander. Later models include the ASfz-12 six-leg artillery
platform and ASfz-36 ten-leg troop carrier. Other models, such as
amphibious and cargo variants, were produced for civilian export.</p>

<p>other ground vehicles are massive (landships) so pre-crp this is the
only car-ish-sized way to go. look at a Boxer IFV and imagine it has
legs. also since greyhound loves to export everything, assume that there
are a ton of variants including whatever youre thinking of</p>
