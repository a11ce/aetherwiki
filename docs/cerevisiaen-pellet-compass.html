        <p>The <strong>Cerevisiaen pellet compass</strong> is a
sociopolitical and militaristic device called “the next necessary
development of <a href="cerevis.html" class="wikilink">Cerevis</a>” by
Cerevisaen leader Scamdalf Drongo, who first introduced the concept in
568 in his Handbook for Revolutionary Warfare. Following his claim that
war is “logical and inevitable”, the pellet compass was intended to
determine the maximum resistance offered by revolutionary tribes seeking
to become incorporated into the macroeconomic totality of the Cerevis
movement. The name derives from the unique militaristic procedure
proposed by Drongo based on the covert operations possible with <a
href="airgun.html" class="wikilink">airguns</a> and airborne
pellets.</p>
<p>The idea was later espoused in several other publications by Drongo,
especially in the later chapters of Revolutionary Path but also in works
such as The Struggle Continues and I Speak of Freedom. Admiral Steve
took up the call for the pellet compass in his last publication, The
Challenge of DeSpaceMarines. Other notable speakers such as Donkey Khan
took up the call in the 570s and 580s, with polemic inspiring those who
had endured suffering to incorporate the compass into their work. In the
590s the pellet compass, after much popularity throughout Cerevis, began
a decline that culminated with the 602 Council resolution effectively
declaring it no longer desirable, citing the possibility of torture and
yielding of minor results.</p>
