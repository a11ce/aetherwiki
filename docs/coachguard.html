        <p><strong>Coachguard</strong> is an international logistics
security company specializing in convoy escort, route protection, and
airborne rapid response. It is headquartered in <a href="ternmouth.html"
class="wikilink">Ternmouth</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Coachguard was founded as the Coach and Rail Guard in 180 as a loose
organization of mercenaries in Tilia available for hire from a central
office. It quickly became popular among transport drivers, and won a
large contract from <a href="northwind-rail.html"
class="wikilink">Northwind Rail</a> in 218. It incorporated as
Coachguard in 224.</p>
<p>Coachguard supplied soldiers during the <a href="locust-war.html"
class="wikilink">Locust War</a> as aeromech crews. They were given half
of Goldwind’s aeromech stock in 477 and assigned them to <a
href="coachguard-nord.html" class="wikilink">Coachguard Nord</a> in
489.</p>
<h2 id="organization">Organization</h2>
<p>Coachguard operates several divisions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coachguard Rail is specfically tasked with Northwind Rail
security.</li>
<li>Coachguard Aviation operates light aircraft.</li>
<li>Coachguard Gold is an unadvertised direct action division.</li>
<li>Coachguard Nord is a Monnais subsidiary. It commonly runs security
for <a href="boreal-ice-cutters.html" class="wikilink">Boreal Ice
Cutters</a>.</li>

<p>tilia basically outsources their military to these guys, there’s like
50k of them</p>
<p>they actually do specialize in protective actions but are definitely
capable of outright warfare</p>
<p>also i am now realizing that i forgot to add the division that just
does other contracts for hire. that exists too. they also kept some
aeromechs and otherwise ride horses or ride along in whatever theyre
guarding (usually wheeled trains)</p>
