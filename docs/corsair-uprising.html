<p>The <strong>Corsair Uprising</strong> was a period of conflict and
later war of independence in which <a href="ikara.html"
class="wikilink">Ikara</a> broke from <a href="arkand.html"
class="wikilink">Arkandic</a> colonial rule between 278 and 284.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>In mid 278, the Overseas Directorate instituted a tax on all
commercial voyages by Ikaran-flagged ships, even within Ikara. Some
Corsairs began contracting directly with transitting ships, bypassing
the registry system and undercutting government prices. Those who were
caught were barred from working for the Maritime Union, and sometimes
arrested as traitors.</p>
<p>Allegedly due to lost revenue, the Overseas Directorate shut down the
wildlife control service in late 278. Beast attacks, especially near the
white forest, because more frequent. Towns in the north formed local
militias to combat them and hired blacklisted sailors to transport
weapons and other equipment along the Fox River.</p>
<h2 id="uprising">Uprising</h2>
<p>On 279.1.14, the captain of one of these ships was docked in
Southbar. He began bragging about the scale of the militia operations,
and an off-duty <a href="acss.html" class="wikilink">ACSS</a> officer
overheared. A fight broke out, and the captain was wounded. News spread
quickly throughout the eastern coast, and several ports began turning
away Arkandic government ships in protest.</p>
<p>In response, the Overseas Directorate required the presence of ACSS
“guards” on all Ikaran commercial ships. Armed ships not flying the ACSS
pennant would be assumed to be pirates. Very few Corsairs complied with
this order, leading to skirmishes between them and Arkandic warships. In
279.9, Captain Barrett, the leader of a significant revolutionary fleet,
sank the AOD Ruhig and captured its officers as hostages. He brought
them to Southbar, by now in open revolt against Arkandic rule.</p>
<p>Arkand declared a state of emergency, outlawed all Ikaran ships
operating as Corsairs, and sent Maritime Union warships to clear te
Etalameri pass entirely. Fighting escalated into open coastal and inland
warfare. The Ikaran militia forces were assisted by Tilian volunteers.
Arkand withdrew in 284 in exchange for the release of the officers of
the Ruhig.</p>
