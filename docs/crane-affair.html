                 </header>
        <p>The <strong>Crane Affair</strong> was a smuggling scandal in
<a href="tilia.html" class="wikilink">Tilia</a> regarding the export of
<a href="clairon.html" class="wikilink">M2 Cranes</a> to <a
href="ikara.html" class="wikilink">Ikara</a> by Tilian farmers in
violation of <a href="pax-centralis.html" class="wikilink">Pax
Centralis</a> sanctions. The sanctions, imposed in response to new
Ikaran internal security policies seen as repressive, barred the export
of dual-use equipment including aircraft. The exposure of the smuggling
triggered Pax seizures of <a href="goldwind.html"
class="wikilink">Goldwind</a>-owned <a href="aeromech.html"
class="wikilink">aeromechanical vehicles</a> and the creation of the <a
href="orange-stripe.html" class="wikilink">Orange Stripe</a>
designation.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>In the 450s, the Ikaran government had begun to consolidate executive
power by means of the Harmonization Edicts. These laws were ostensibly
an effort to streamline governmental operations, increasing executive
power over existing federal agencies. They also established a national
<a href="wizard.html" class="wikilink">wizard</a> registry and
compulsory technical service program, with unlicensed magical practice
punishable by death. Wizards in compulsory service were instructed to
perform rituals and spells without proper training or attunement, and
several deaths were apparently covered up by the Ikaran federal
government. The Pax Consuls of Diplomacy and Industry jointly issued a
prohibition of export for any mechanical or aetherpower devices with
potential military applications.</p>
<p>After the death of Curtis Claire in 474, during the <a
href="locust-war.html" class="wikilink">Locust War</a>, use of the M2
Crane in heavily infested areas was considered prohibitively dangerous,
and the airframe was largely set aside after Goldwind purchased 90 M5
Albatross airframes. The M5s were largely financed by high-interest debt
taken on by Goldwind itself, which effectively became the responsibility
of individual farm owners.</p>
<h2 id="smuggling-plot">Smuggling plot</h2>
<p>The smuggling operation was led by James Wyatt, the treasurer and
quartermaster of Calder Bend Airstrip. On 475.3.2, he contacted an
underground broker in <a href="montrevieux.html"
class="wikilink">Montrevieux</a> who had put out an ad offering to buy
unserialized ‘irrigation platforms’, understood to mean small aircraft.
The broker connected him with Ikaran Naval Aviation Lieutenant Lio
Ansel. Lt. Ansel oversaw procurement at the North Acheron Depot, south
of Fox River and east of the White River Forest.</p>
<p>Wyatt, on behalf of Calder Bend Airstrip, purchased several tons of
scrap metal from nearby Windbreak Township, which had been completely
devastated by locusts. The scrap metal was delivered to Calder Bend
Railyard, where it sat as Wyatt and the Airstrip’s head mechanic Marie
Burin broke down six M2s and loaded them onto the railcars. Wyatt
contacted the Ikaran Public Works Office who agreed to purchase what
they thought was scrap metal at an inflated price under direction from
Lt. Ansel. Wyatt presented this to Jerry Kint, the owner of Calder Bend,
who approved the transaction.</p>
<p>The scrap metal and Cranes were delivered to North Acheron Depot by
Southern Agricultural. The scrap was presumably forwarded to the Public
Works Department. The Cranes were rebuilt by INA mechanics at the depot
using parts cannibalized from other nonfunctional aircraft.</p>
<h2 id="investigation">Investigation</h2>
<p>In 478.9.17, a Crane in INA livery crashed on the Kota side of the
White River. The pilot was found dead, and the aircraft was taken in by
Kota border guards for inspection. Mechanics determined that the cause
of the crash was a thruster failure characteristic to a specific Crane
production run from 468. These Cranes were produced by <a
href="sikutech.html" class="wikilink">SikuTech</a> under license, and
the run was cut short by Clairon after multiple safety issues were
reported.</p>
<p>Kota consulted with SikuTech, who confirmed that most thrusters from
that run had been recovered and replaced under warranty. SikuTech
provided a list of unaccounted-for serial numbers and the firms that had
recieved them. At the request of the Pax Consul of Diplomacy, The <a
href="pax-marshals-bureau.html" class="wikilink">Pax Marshals Bureau</a>
was tasked with identifying the location or fate of every airframe on
the list.</p>
<p>The Bureau initially suspected that the airframes had been stolen by
Ikaran operatives and began to conduct interviews with the listed firms.
Several companies acknowledged decommissioning Cranes and selling them
to scrapyards. This made them almost impossible to conclusively trace,
as no scrapyards kept records of the serial numbers of broken
aircraft.</p>
<p>By 479.2, the Bureau’s only concrete lead was six serial numbers that
both Calder Bend Airstrip and United Leasing reported having received
and later decommissioned. Investigators spoke with the distribution
office that directly purchased the Cranes, who stated that they were
sold to United Leasing.</p>
<p>Jerry Kint was arrested by Pax Marshals on 479.4.10 in Ternmouth. He
maintained that he had no knowledge of the specific airframes owned by
Calder Bend, and that all transfer paperwork had been handled by his
treasurer. He admitted to approving the scrap sale after Wyatt presented
him with the terms, choosing not to look too closely at the windfall. He
also stated that Wyatt had previously found several other unconventional
funding sources for the Airstrip, but that he did not believe that Wyatt
would go so far as to break supranational law.</p>
<p>On 479.4.19, five Marshals along with the sheriff of Calder Bend
executed a warrant at Calder Bend Airstrip for the arrest of James
Wyatt. While searching a hangar, they were ambushed by Wyatt and Burin.
One Marshal and the sheriff were wounded in the initial exchange of <a
href="airgun.html" class="wikilink">airgun</a> fire. After a two-hour
standoff, the Marshals secured the surrender of Burin. Wyatt attempted
to flee immediately after and was shot dead by the sheriff.</p>
<h2 id="prosecutions">Prosecutions</h2>
<p>The Pax Consul of Diplomacy Office indicted Jerry Kint and Marie
Burin. The Ikaran government denied official involvement and refused to
cooperate in the investigation.</p>
<p>Kint was tried in Pax State Court in New Harbor on charges of evading
sanctions and falsifying rail manifests. Prosecutors argued that he
willfully ignored obvious irregularities in Wyatt’s financing scheme,
and he was convicted on one count of evading sanctions and received a
two-year suspended sentence, which was completed without activation.</p>
<p>Burin pled guilty to aggravated assault in the Tilian Royal Court and
was sentenced to 12 years’ imprisonment. Upon her release, she fled to
Ikara to escape trial in State Court, and is believed to have fled again
during the Ikaran Civil Revolt.</p>
<p>Lio Ansel’s involvement came to light in the Reconciliation Trials
after the Civil Revolt and he was executed for misconduct leading to the
death of the test pilot who crashed in Kota.</p>
<p>In parallel with the criminal cases, the Pax Consul of Diplomacy
issued a sanctions enforcement order authorizing civil forfeiture of
assets materially linked to prohibited exports. Under this authority,
Marshals planned to seize a number of Goldwind-owned aeromechs and sell
them to municipalities across Pax. Execution of the seizure was deferred
until 486 to avoid undue interference with the ongoing Locust War.</p>
<h2 id="reactions">Reactions</h2>
<p>Frontier farmers and Goldwind members condemned the aeromech seizures
as collective punishment that hindered post-war rebuilding, arguing that
the diverted aeromechs were needed for construction work and farming.
Others supported the prosecutions and seizures, citing the danger of
exporting military equipment to Ikara during a period of reported
human-rights abuses.</p>
<p>The affair exposed gaps in the traceability of IPRO-funded supplies.
To avoid future misappropriation, IPRO created the <a
href="orange-stripe.html" class="wikilink">Orange Stripe</a> designation
to track items subsidized by the IPRO crisis stockpile. Serial numbers
for all Orange Stripe items are published in a public ledger, and
transfer or resale requires disclosure and approval from the IPRO Crisis
Team.</p>
