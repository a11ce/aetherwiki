        <p>The <strong>Emerald Circuit</strong> was a smuggling and
fraud operation that began during the <a href="black-air-conflict.html"
class="wikilink">Black Air Conflict</a>. The ring was orchestrated by
ONC Deputy Captain Lucia Voroshin.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>By 428, many ONC ships ran on <a href="aether-density.html"
class="wikilink">emerald air</a> purchased under an <a
href="onc-ztk-refinery-agreement.html" class="wikilink">exclusive
contract</a> from the <a href="zalo-technical-kyro.html"
class="wikilink">Zalo Technical Kyro</a>. During the Black Air Conflict,
the price of emerald air from <a href="kota.html"
class="wikilink">Kota</a> refineries jumped to over 300<a
href="phi.html" class="wikilink">phi</a> per barrel as the few active
refineries struggled to meet export demand.</p>
<p>The Governors of the ONC initially considered breaking the contract
unilaterally, but a commissioned assessment from <a href="mariposa.html"
class="wikilink">Mariposa</a> warned that doing so could trigger an
embargo from Kota, putting the company under an effectively indefinite
Qamari fuel monopoly and possibly locking them out of the Kota market
entirely.</p>
<h2 id="the-scheme">The Scheme</h2>
<h3 id="initial-steps">Initial steps</h3>
<p>One week after the <a href="kota-refinery-disasters.html"
class="wikilink">Qime refinery disaster</a>, Captain Voroshin privately
contracted the <a href="arkand.html" class="wikilink">Arkandic Maritime
Union</a> to install false bulkheads in four ships under her command:
ONCF Ostro, ONC Ponente, ONC Levante, and ONC Tramontane.</p>
<h3 id="procedure">Procedure</h3>
<ul>
<li>The ships were loaded with emerald air in Cadaz, Qamar as if for
export to Monnais. They then sailed to a private dock in the
Soeur-Verron canton of Monnais owned by Edwin Terl, a conspirator in the
ring.</li>
<li>In Soeur-Verron, Terl’s dockworkers moved the emerald barrels behind
the false bulkheads and loaded a legitimate shipment of blue barrels
bound for Stolmont. The crews were swapped out as per standard ONC
procedure.</li>
<li>In Stolmont, the blue barrels were (legally) unloaded. The ship’s
officers then collapsed the false bulkhead, revealing the emerald
barrels. New crews were boarded and told that they were sailing the
second leg of a route from Kota to the ONC fuel depot.</li>
<li>Upon arrival in Marisa, the ONC was presented with forged custody
documents and receipts from the Zalo refineries and paid Captain
Voroshin accordingly. Skeleton crews embarked for a routine relocation
to Cadaz.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="investigation">Investigation</h2>
<h3 id="initial-suspicion">Initial suspicion</h3>
<p>During the mandated refinery shutdown immediately after the Vosa
explosion, IPRO began to keep exact counts of emerald barrels leaving
Kota from existing stockpiles to ensure that no illicit refinement was
taking place. After the shutdown order was lifted, IPRO continued to
closely monitor production and export in case of longer term unrest in
Kota or secession from the Pax Centralis. This was done in secret so as
not to escalate tensions in the region.</p>
<p>As part of its normal duties, IPRO also kept track of emerald air
entering the ONC fuel depot in Marisa. This led to a discrepancy in
accounting: 4-9% of the emerald barrels being imported by the ONC each
month appeared to be coming from somewhere other than Kota. This was
initially assumed to be a clerical error caused by the general chaos of
the Black Air Conflict, but by 431 the IPRO Analytics Team was confident
that Kota exports were being completely counted and an audit request was
sent to the newly-founded Enforcement Team.</p>
<h3 id="ipro-et-investigation">IPRO-ET investigation</h3>
<p>The Enforcement Team first raised the issue quietly with the
Governors of the ONC. General contract enforcement is not within their
jurisdiction, and an admission of extra-contractual Qamari importing
would have meant the end of the investigation. However, the ONC
vehemently denied any Qamari imports. IPRO-ET became suspicious that
this was a coverup by ONC leadership, either simply fearful of IPRO
interference in a contract breach or perpetrating some other illegal
practices.</p>
<p>Since 428, IPRO had mandated that all importers of emerald barrels
keep chain-of-custody documentation. This regulation was negotiated with
shipping companies, including the ONC, who fought for the ability to
keep these documents private unless legally compelled due to concerns of
corporate espionage. IPRO-ET subpoenaed ONC’s custody records for the
duration of the ONC-ZTK contract, which stated that all emerald imports
had come from the ZTK.</p>
<p>After confirming that specific serialized barrels recorded in the
custody documentation were not present in the list of ZTK-exported
barrels, the ET formed Task Force Green Mirror and hired financial
analysts from <a href="acuto.html" class="wikilink">Acuto</a> in order
to investigate and potentially prosecute the ONC for forging custody
records.</p>
<h3 id="task-force-green-mirror">Task Force Green Mirror</h3>
<p>In 433, the IPRO Enforcement Team infiltrated the Cadaz docks and
marked the seals of a number of barrels allocated for export to Monnais.
Soon after, the same barrels were found on the ONC Tramontane during
assessment at the ONC fuel import center in Marisa. Inspectors
immediately signaled an ET tactical squad on standby.</p>
<p>The tactical squad boarded the ONC Tramontane, seized the
conclusively fraudulent documentation claiming Kota origin for the
barrels marked in Cadaz, and arrested all senior officers on board.
Lucia Voroshin was not among them, and a warrant was put out for her
arrest. The other three ships in the fleet were detained under an
administrative hold. IPRO engineers conducted a safety inspection and
discovered the false bulkheads in all four ships.</p>
<h2 id="exposure">Exposure</h2>
<p>Director Krenk, Commanding Officer of the Enforcement Team, released
a statement accusing the Governors of the ONC of fraud and banning the
ONC from importing regulated aether to any IPRO signatory port. This was
protested by the Marisa Commercial Congress on the grounds that non-ONC
sailors and citizens of Marisa effectively relied on the ONC and would
be unduly harmed by such a drastic decrease in ONC activity. Foreseeing
the need for cooperation with Marisa, IPRO leadership overruled the
Enforcement Team and suspended the ban.</p>
<p>The next day, payments to the Arkandic Maritime Union for vaguely
described refitting work were found in Captain Voroshin’s personal
ledger by Acuto analysts. IPRO-ET requested a search warrant from the
Arkandic Combined Security Syndicate.</p>
<h3 id="mariposa-audit">Mariposa audit</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, the ONC hired Mariposa to trace the origin and path of the
mislabeled barrels. Mariposa determined that the barrels came from a
Qamari collection operation run by Buyan Kertu. Kertu claimed to have
sold the barrels to the ONC for export to Monnais and to have interacted
only with Captain Voroshin. This was deemed plausible given the level of
autonomy at which ONC Deputy Captains operate.</p>
<p>Based on ONC crew records, Mariposa interviewed hundreds of sailors
who had worked for Voroshin, eventually finding an anomaly: when in
Soeur-Verron, Voroshin would always dock at a particular facility
instead of going through the normal ONC dock assignment procedure.
Mariposa reported this to the ONC, who hired <a href="egide.html"
class="wikilink">Egide</a> to investigate the facility on the
ground.</p>
<h3 id="egide-raid">Egide raid</h3>
<p>Egide obtained a private security warrant from the Soeur-Verron court
under the pretext of an imminent hazardous leak from improperly stored
aether and conducted a raid during normal operating hours. The owner of
the dock, Edwin Terl, was detained along with all present workers. In
exchange for immunity for his employees, Terl confessed to supervising
the bulkhead swap operations and forging docking logs for Voroshin. He
also revealed the location of Voroshin’s Monnais residence in <a
href="montrevieux.html" class="wikilink">Montrevieux</a>. Voroshin was
arrested by Egide and turned over to Mariposa at the ONC Montrevieux
office for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="resolution">Resolution</h3>
<p>When IPRO confronted the Governors of the ONC about their apparent
payments to the AMU for the installation of smuggling facilities on
their ships, the Governors realized that even a full confession from
Voroshin would not prevent them from being implicated. They released
Voroshin into IPRO-ET custody and began building a case for corporate
uninvolvement.</p>
<p>Critically, Mariposa discovered that all payments in connection with
the Circuit were sent from an ONC bank account registered to Voroshin in
her personal capacity, not to her fleet. This type of account was not
visible to ONC treasury staff and the payments were not subject to any
higher approval.</p>
<p>They also located Voroshin’s account at the Bank of Monnais and
matched incoming payments to the expected difference between Kota and
Qamar emerald air prices. This demonstrated that the scheme did not
benefit ONC as a whole and that it was entirely plausible that nobody
higher up than Voroshin was aware of the scheme.</p>
<p>The Governors of the ONC, eager to show cooperation, presented this
evidence to IPRO-ET. This was accompanied by a settlement proposal,
offering restitution for levies lost during the ONC aether shipping ban,
surrender of the modified vessels, and future at-will access to custody
documentation. After some deliberation, and against the wishes of the
ET, IPRO accepted the proposal under pressure to avoid the inevitable
global economic crisis that disrupting the ONC would cause.</p>
<h2 id="aftermath">Aftermath</h2>
<p>Lucia Voroshin was tried in an IPRO tribunal for smuggling while in
custody, then in the Marisa Commercial Court for fraud, and finally in
absentia by the Supreme Court of Kota for forgery.</p>
<p>She was acquitted of smuggling as all relevant levies had still been
paid to Marisa inspectors. She was convicted by the Marisa Commercial
Court and sentenced to 10 years in jail, and by the Supreme Court of
Kota for forgery and ordered to pay 300,000phi to the ZTK. Voroshin’s
whereabouts after being released from jail in Marisa are unknown, but
she is widely believed to have gone to <a href="amberlee.html"
class="wikilink">Amberlee</a>. Her Kota fine remains unpaid.</p>
<p>Terl accepted a plea agreement from Soeur-Verron and was sentenced to
3 years of civic labor. He was also barred by IPRO from any involvement
in the aether trade. He later emigrated to <a href="lusquo.html"
class="wikilink">Lusquo</a> and worked on a seaweed trawler.</p>
<p>Egide was sanctioned by the Soeur-Verron court for perjury in filing
a warrant request and banned from operating in the canton for 5
years.</p>
<p>The Tramontane was refitted as an inspection and tactical training
vessel at the IPRO dock in Marisa. The Ostro, Ponente, and Levante were
stripped of their false bulkheads by IPRO engineers and subsequently
auctioned, with proceeds given to the ZTK.</p>
<p>All ONC officers with knowledge of the scheme were exiled from the
ONC. Two of them were later discovered to have been working for the <a
href="acss.html" class="wikilink">Arkand Combined Security Syndicate</a>
while serving as ONC officers. They remain wanted for further
questioning in connection with ACSS involvement in the <a
href="lock-19-blockade.html" class="wikilink">Lock 19 Blockade</a>.</p>
