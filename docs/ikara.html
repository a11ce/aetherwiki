<p><strong>Ikara</strong> is a country located in southeastern <a
href="lanteen.html" class="wikilink">Lanteen</a>. It borders <a
href="tilia.html" class="wikilink">Tilia</a> to the north and <a
href="kota.html" class="wikilink">Kota</a> to the west. About half of
its territory is on various islands in <a href="etalameri.html"
class="wikilink">Etalameri</a>, south of the Lanteen mainland. Its
capital is Southbar, a large city on the eastern coast.</p>
<h2 id="government">Government</h2>
<p>The Administrative Charter of Ikara, in effect since 505, assigns
each executive office a specified mandate and creates a legislature made
up of appointed members of all executive offices. Any change to the
mandate of an office requires a direct vote by all Ikaran citizens.</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<h3 id="colonial-period">Colonial period</h3>
<p>Ikara was a colony of <a href="arkand.html"
class="wikilink">Arkand</a> until 278, administered by the Overseas
Directorate. Ikaran citizens were not allowed to join Arkandic
syndicates, and were not allowed to return to Ikara or join the Overseas
Directorate if they became citizens of Arkand.</p>
<p>Arkandic governance was mostly focused on the Etalameri Pass, a sea
route through the southern islands. The Etalameri pass is one of the two
routes connecting the <a href="laumeri.html"
class="wikilink">Laumeri</a> and <a href="kylmeri.html"
class="wikilink">Kylmeri</a>, and Arkand was able to charge transit fees
to ships sailing through it. The Maritime Union employed local
privateers, known as Corsairs, to guide ships through the rocky pass and
protect from piracy.</p>
<p>The colonial period ended with the <a href="corsair-uprising.html"
class="wikilink">Corsair Uprising</a>.</p>
<h3 id="federation-period">Federation period</h3>
<p>Early state-building in Ikara was characterized by an intense push
towards gaining internal and international legitimacy. The revolution
was largely led by Corsairs, who were often seen as mavericks and
pirates by mainland residents. The new government in Southbar also had
to prove that they could be relied on to keep trade safely flowing
through the Etalameri Pass.</p>
<p>Many executive offices were established. Their headquarters were
spread across Ikara to make the federal government locally visible. This
was supported by the construction of an expansive phosgraph network, the
first of many similar public works projects. See below for a list of
Ikaran executive offices.</p>
<p>In 286, the Coast Guard offered amnesty to former pirate crews
willing to serve Ikara. Many former Corsairs joined as Etalameri guides.
Others banded together as the <a href="bloodsails.html"
class="wikilink">Bloodsails</a>.</p>
<p>By late 289, trade through Etalameri was restored to pre-Uprising
levels.</p>
<h3 id="harmonization-period">Harmonization period</h3>
<p>Ikaran executive offices operated with a high degree of autonomy. A
series of issues came to light in the first half of the 400s that
highlighted the drawbacks of a geographically distributed federal
government.</p>
<p>These included duplicate government programs, safety issues in the
Technical Service, nepotism in promotions and procurement, and
inter-office competition. Many of these issues were publicized by rival
offices.</p>
<p>To combat this, the Federal Office passed a series of edicts intended
to centralize and modernizes the executive offices. The first of these,
in 450, relocated all executive offices to Southbar, leading to mass
turnover in the lower ranks. Recruitment for the relocated offices
emphasized the Harmonization Plan as a second Ikaran revolution. The
relocation angered citizens across Ikara, especially former employees of
relatively powerful offices. The Federal Office was unsympathetic, and
deployed the <a href="ikaran-park-service.html" class="wikilink">Ikaran
Park Service</a> as an internal peacekeeping force.</p>
<p>Later edicts continued to centralize Federal Office power, reducing
other executive offices to subordinate agencies. After the <a
href="crane-affair.html" class="wikilink">Crane Affair</a>, all
procurement and budgeting was put under the jurisdiction of the Federal
Office. The <a href="starlight.html" class="wikilink">Starlight
Phosgraph Union</a> was also banned in 497 in favor of direct federal
administration of the network. This led junior government employees
without access to federal bulletins to create informal communication
networks.</p>
<h3 id="civil-revolt">Civil Revolt</h3>
<p>By 501, these networks had formalized into the Coalition of Civil
Officers. In 502.10, government phosgraph operators broadcast Coalition
demands for a repeal of the harmonization edicts. The Federal Office
declared the broadcasts as seditious, and ordered Park Service divisions
to capture phosgraph towers. Most rangers, including those who had not
previously been sympathetic to the Revolt, refused.</p>
<p>Commander Silva, acting director of the Park Service, issued a
blanket order that IPS rangers were to ignore Federal commands to act
outside their duties. He then resigned, leaving his command to a junior
officer in Coalition leadership.</p>
<p>Silva took with him a number of IPS divisions, and marched on
Southbar along with a delegation of Coalition representatives. After a
twenty-six hour standoff in heavy rain, the Federal Office agreed to
vacate its complex if all officers were allowed to leave freely. Most of
them fled internationally.</p>
<p>The Coalition formed a provisional federal government, who
immediately repealed the harmonization edicts and began to plan a new
structure of government for Ikara. In the interim, a Reconciliation
Commission was established to identify and prosecute misconduct by
former members of the Federal Office and other high-ranking civil
officers. In 505, the provisional government enacted the Administrative
Charter, defining the modern Ikaran state.</p>
