        <p>IPRO is a <a href="pax-centralis.html"
class="wikilink">Pax</a>-based international regulatory agency founded
in 236 after two compressor explosions were linked to mislabelled
pressure vessels.</p>
<p>IPRO was initially tasked with issuing pressure certificates upon
densimeter inspection of barrels. This was done at the <a
href="nordovest-institute.html" class="wikilink">Nordovest Institute</a>
Pressure Lab in <a href="tilia.html" class="wikilink">Tilia</a> on
request by transiting ships. These paper certificates were affixed to
the outside of barrels, and were often illegally kept when the barrel
was refilled. This ad-hoc system was acceptable for the time; firms
importing barrels for pressure-critical operations would send a
represenative to Liara to attend the pressure certification and then
accompany the shipment to its destination. By 340, several other nations
had signed on to the governing treaty.</p>
<p>The widespread adoption of <a href="triplex-compressor.html"
class="wikilink">triplex compressors</a> was initially thought to render
pressure certification obsolete: triplex compressors fill a standardized
container with air of a standard pressure. This was proven wrong in 410,
when counterfeit triplex-compressed containers flooded the <a
href="itaan.html" class="wikilink">Itaan</a> market, leading to numerous
fatal accidents. In response, the IPRO Board proposed the <a
href="blue-stripe-levy.html" class="wikilink">blue-stripe levy</a> to
the Pax senate. After some negotiation regarding the distribution of
funds, it got full Pax support and was effectively made law in 413.</p>

<p>The IPRO Oversight Team works with local inspectors. They wear
sky-blue vests.</p>
<p>Since 431, IPRO also has an Enforcement Team. They accompany
Oversight officers or conduct independent action. They were trained and
initially led by <a href="egide.html" class="wikilink">Egide</a>. Half
of the ET is permanently stationed in Liara.</p>
