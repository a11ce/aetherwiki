<p><strong>Kogane</strong> is an island nation occupying the kogane
Archipelago in <a href="laumeri.html" class="wikilink">Laumeri</a>.
Historically a maritime trading power with diplomatic missions across
the world, Kogane withdrew from traditional international diplomacy
after the <a href="nine-knot-war.html" class="wikilink">Nine Knot
War</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<h3 id="pre-enchantment">Pre-Enchantment</h3>
<p>Kogane shipbuilders and captains founded <a
href="delsin-station.html" class="wikilink">Delsin Station</a> as a
repair and transport hub.</p>
<p>The Nine Knot Line, a government-owned ferry and mail service, ran
between <a href="kogane.html" class="wikilink">Kogane</a>, <a
href="delsin.html" class="wikilink">Delsin</a>, and <a href="ikara.html"
class="wikilink">Ikara</a>, and <a href="stolmont.html"
class="wikilink">Stolmont</a>.</p>
<h3 id="nine-knot-war">Nine Knot War</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>See: <a href="nine-knot-war.html" class="wikilink">Nine Knot
War</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the early 220s, the <a href="wake-society.html"
class="wikilink">Wake Society</a>, a <a
href="maritime-traditionalism.html"
class="wikilink">maritime-traditionalist</a> party, gained significant
open and covert influence throughout Kogane. On 228.2.27, two Wake
Society paramilitary operatives, Ranmaru Ito and Naho Okabe, stole a
Nine Knot Line ferry from <a href="delsin-station.html"
class="wikilink">Delsin Station</a> with the intention of docking at the
Lantong Plaza in <a href="tesser.html" class="wikilink">Tesser</a> and
reading a manifesto in support of maritime-traditionalism. On approach,
a Stolmont Security Office commander mistook the manifesto for a
weaponized scroll and fired on the ferry, killing both Wake Society
members and leading the ferry to run aground.</p>
<p>Stolmont believed the Lantong Plaza Incident to be a failed attack by
the Kogane military, and sent ships to blockade Delsin Station and use
the Delsin phosgraph tower to contact Kogane demanding an explanation
for the events at Lantong. Hina Teruoka, a phosgraph relay operator in
Veshu and Wake Society member, censored the message on orders from Ito
to suppress information regarding the planned Lantong demonstration.
Facing what they saw as an unprovoked blockade of Delsin Station, Kogane
declared war on Stolmont on 228.2.30.</p>
<p>The Kogane government soon realized the full extent of the situation,
but was unable to convince Stolmont that the Lantong incident had not
been a government-sanctioned attack. The Kogane Coastal Defense Service
was unable to break the blockade, and the war devolved into a stalemate
by early 230, leaving Delsin Station occupied by the SSO. In 231, Kogane
formally surrendered their claims on Delsin to Stolmont.</p>
<h3 id="wake-society-investigations">Wake Society Investigations</h3>
<p>After the signing of the Instrument of Delsin, the Wake and
Prosperity coalition government launched a series of inquiries into
matters of public concern raised in the course of the war. One such
inquiry regarded what was seen as a transmission failure of Stolmont’s
initial phosgraph regarding the Lantong incident and blockade. The
stated goal of the inquiry was to determine the process inadequacy
responsible for the error and institute changes as needed. Many
Prosperity representatives were also interested in applying the
protocols of the <a href="starlight.html" class="wikilink">Starlight
Phosgraph Union</a> to the Kogane network or possibly applying for full
membership.</p>
<p>In late 232, Hina Teruoka was called to testify in front of the
parliamentary committee charged with investigating the dropped message.
Instead of answering the questions asked by the committee, she read a
prepared speech honoring Ito and Okabe and admitting to deliberately
omitting Stolmont’s request for information regarding the Lantong
incident when forwarding the message. As attention turned towards the
true extent of clandestine Wake Society activities before and during the
war, federal police uncovered evidence of collaboration between
high-ranking Kogane military officers loyal to the Wake Society and
foreign maritime-traditionalist paramilitary organizations. Many
prominent Wake Society politicians were revealed to be aware of or
assisting the Society in activities that were deemed contrary to the
national aims of Kogane.</p>
<h3 id="rise-of-the-khf">Rise of the KHF</h3>
<p>The Wake Society investigations were followed by mass protests
against the ruling coalition and calls for the resignation of all Wake
Society representatives then in parliament. Fearing violent revolt, many
Wake Society representatives fled the country and the remaining Wake and
Prosperity coalition members scheduled snap elections for 233.4.</p>
<p>During the lead-up to these elections, the Kogane Homeland Focus
party, led by Takumi Endo and previously a niche ideological group,
garnered significant popular support. The KHF campaigned on a promise to
prevent another disaster like the Nine Knot War, arguing that Kogane
could not afford to allow independent organizations to grow unchecked
power within and in place of the federal government. After KHF-aligned
protestors disrupted Prosperity Party rallies, several factions of the
Prosperity Party moved to become part of the KHF under threat of
continued interference. The KHF won an outright majority in the snap
elections.</p>
<p>Takumi Endo, now the chief of the Kogane parliament, immediately
began personally orchestrating parliamentary actions to an unprecedented
degree. In 233, the Wake Society was declared an illegal parastate, and
the few remaining Wake Society representatives were expelled from
parliament. Claiming that there were still subversive elements present
in other political parties, Endo and the KHF delayed the required
elections for their replacements indefinitely.</p>
<p>In 234, the Kogane government banned a number of independent
political publications. Endo argued that the Wake Society had gained
support among students (including Okabe and Teruoka) by means of its
magazines, and similar publications could enable the creation of new
parastates. This policy faced some opposition, including within the KHF,
but people were largely unwilling to stand up for any particular named
publication. Endo additionally targeted the Ministry of Foreign
Correspondence, initially by requiring review of all outgoing and
incoming messages by CDS soldiers. He soon became convinced that the MFC
was too much of a risk in allowing for parastate operations
internationally.</p>

<h2 id="government-and-politics">Government and Politics</h2>
<p>Kogane is a parliamentary republic in which royal houses serve as
membership markers that confer no power. Foreign affairs are governed by
the Ministry of Exterior Houses, which charters and supervises envoys,
and the Ministry of Foreign Correspondence. The MFC was effectively
shuttered during the Envoy Period.</p>
<p>Each island has its own civil administration which handles local
services. Representative divisions are designated to create equal
population and are not coterminous with islands.</p>
<p>Coalitions in parliament are fluid. Common political issues include
cooperation with IPRO, envoy autonomy, and arts funding. <a
href="maritime-traditionalism.html" class="wikilink">Maritime
traditionalism</a> is effectively a defunct ideology in Kogane following
the disastrous Nine Knot War, and the <a href="wake-society.html"
class="wikilink">Wake Society</a> is explicitly banned as a political
party.</p>

<p>The Coastal Defense Service is a small fleet of ships and patrol

<p>Envoy security is hired from local firms. In cases of extreme danger
(such as during the <a href="black-air-conflict.html"
class="wikilink">Black Air Conflict</a>), CDS Marines may be sent to
protect or evacuate envoys.</p>
