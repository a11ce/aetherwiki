        <p>The <strong>Vosanite Refinery Disasters</strong> were a
series of accidents at <a href="vosanite.html"
class="wikilink">vosanite</a> refineries in the late 420s and early
430s, including a waste spill in Qime in 428 and a tank overpressure
explosion in Vosa in 431.</p>
<h3 id="qime">Qime</h3>
<p>In 428, a catastrophic process failure in the Qime refinery complex
led to a 6 hour uncontrolled venting of refinement by-product gas, known
as ‘black air’. The town of Qime was evacuated and the area is still
uninhabitable.</p>
<p><a href="ipro.html" class="wikilink">IPRO</a> activated relief
protocols, suspending levies on air, food, and medical supplies bound
for nearby ports. The <a href="pax-centralis.html"
class="wikilink">Pax</a> council ordered all vosanite refineries to be
shut down until <a href="liara-canal-authority.html"
class="wikilink">LCA</a> were able to inspect them. This order was
largely ignored, and conflicts between Pax officials and refinery
workers spiraled into a period of mass civil unrest, later called the <a
href="black-air-conflict.html" class="wikilink">Black Air
Conflict</a>.</p>
<h3 id="vosa">Vosa</h3>
<p>In 431, an emerald storage tank at the Vosa train station exploded.
The blast and ensuing fire destroyed several tanker trains in a nearby
yard and killed over 600 rail workers and residents of Vosa. Pax
officials blamed the accident on refineries illegally operating above
quota. IPRO extended its relief terms to the entire western region of
Kota, predicting an economic crisis. This was cited by Nicolas Ducco as
a motivation for the <a href="lock-19-blockade.html"
class="wikilink">Lock 19 Protest</a>.</p>
