                 </header>
        <p>The <strong>Lock 19 Blockade</strong> (also known as the
<strong>Lock 19 Protest</strong>) was a canal blockade in 431 by Liaran
sovereigntists over perceived <a href="ipro.html"
class="wikilink">IPRO</a> overreach in the wake of the <a
href="kota-refinery-disasters.html" class="wikilink">Qime refinery
disaster</a>.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>todo talk about the <a href="black-air-conflict.html"
class="wikilink">black air conflict</a> and Qime</p>
<p>IPRO first activated relief protocols after the Qime disaster in 428,
suspending levies on air, food, and construction materials bound for
affected regions. These measures were expanded across western Kota
following the Vosa explosion in 431.</p>
<h2 id="blockade">Blockade</h2>
<p>Liaran <a href="sovereigntism.html"
class="wikilink">sovereigntists</a> led by Nicolas Ducco, part owner of
Lock 19, conspired with the captain of the ONC Fir to block the entrance
to Lock 19. The Fir dropped its anchor while in the chamber of the lock,
refusing to leave when the exit gate was opened.</p>
<p>In later criminal trials, they stated that they intended to negotiate
for partial levies or some compensation by IPRO, and did not expect any
violence. They also stated a desire to demonstrate the sovereignty of
Liara but not to actually block relief to Kota.</p>
<h2 id="seizure">Seizure</h2>
<p>Two days after the start of the blockade, three teams of soldiers
wearing blue IPRO vests seized the two lock 19 control towers and the
Fir.</p>
<p>At the time, IPRO did not have a standing militarized division, and
these soldiers have not been definitively identified.</p>
<p>Cooperative LCA engineers were brought in under IPRO guard to operate
all locks for the duration of the relief effort.</p>
<h2 id="aftermath">Aftermath</h2>
<p>IPRO creates <a href="ipro.html" class="wikilink">enforcement
team</a>, 20 operators and 4 patrol boats provided by Egide with the
intent to train a larger force. Half of IPRO-ET is permanently stationed
in Liara.</p>
<p>Criminal prosecution of Ducco and other sovereigntists resulting in
forced sale of lock 19, ultimately to <a href="pantheon.html"
class="wikilink">Pantheon</a>.</p>
<p>Captain and crew of the Fir repatriated to Arkand.</p>
<h2 id="alleged-foreign-involvement">Alleged Foreign Involvement</h2>
<p>It is unclear what motivated the captain and crew of the Fir to go
along with this plan. The private intelligence firm <a
href="mariposa.html" class="wikilink">Mariposa</a> has alleged that at
least some of them were <a href="acss.html" class="wikilink">Arkandic
Combined Security Syndicate</a> agents posing as ONC sailors.</p>
<p>When interviewed, Ducco claimed that the IPRO soldiers spoke <a
href="monnais.html" class="wikilink">Monnéen</a> and suggested that they
were hired from <a href="egide.html" class="wikilink">Egide</a>. This is
disputed by Egide.</p>
