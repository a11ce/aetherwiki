<p>The <strong>Locust War</strong> was a pest management campaign
conducted by the <a href="goldwind.html" class="wikilink">Goldwind
Agricultural Cooperative</a> between 472 and 485 with the objective of
eradicating locust swarms in <a href="tilia.html"
class="wikilink">Tilia</a>.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>In the 460s, the cooperative partnered with <a href="sikutech.html"
class="wikilink">SikuTech</a> to develop and sell <a
href="aether-storage.html" class="wikilink">canister</a>-powered farm
equipment to most Tilian farms. While this technology enabled rapid
expansion into nearby wildlands, pest-control practices continued to
rely on local wizards, sometimes operating archaic <a
href="aether-density.html" class="wikilink">gray-grade</a> machines.</p>
<p>The unprecedented productivity growth prompted farmers to allocate
most of their land to single crops (most commonly genetically uniform <a
href="monnais.html" class="wikilink">Monnais</a> wheat) in order to
simplify logistics and sales. Formerly wild prairie lands between
adjacent farms were also cultivated, connecting multiple properties and
creating expansive monocultural tracts.</p>
<p>The combination of vulnerable farms and outdated mitigation
technology culminated in the appearance of locust swarms of
unprecedented size in 472 that quickly began to tear through Tilia.</p>
<h2 id="campaign">Campaign</h2>
<p>In 472, the Goldwind Cooperative enlisted local (to the 7 constituent
farms) crop duster pilots into a pest control air wing. Their <a
href="clairon.html" class="wikilink">M2 Crane</a> aircraft were first
outfitted with standard sprayers modified to hold locust confuser. As
more farms joined Goldwind (and provided more pilots and aircraft to the
campaign), Goldwind’s triplex compressors were not able to keep up with
the demand for blue-grade canisters to power the aircraft. <a
href="ipro.html" class="wikilink">IPRO</a> agreed to subsidize imports
for 3 years until a more efficient distribution mechanism was
developed.</p>
<p>This timeline was cut shorter as it soon became evident that even the
combined capacity of nearly all Cranes in service with Tilian farms
would not be enough to contain the locusts. In 474, a Crane piloted by
Curtis Claire was forced down in an overrun farm after flying through a
dense swarm during a spray mission. By the time his plane was recovered,
only his skeleton remained.</p>
<p>The death of Curtis Claire turned the crisis into a war. Goldwind had
already taken on significant loans, but the risk of permanently losing
arable land justified ever-increasing debt. The cooperative purchased 90
<a href="clairon.html" class="wikilink">M5 Albatross</a> high-altitude
airlifters, able to safely overfly swarms that would be impenetrable by
Cranes. In 478, having exhausted all other funding sources, three
farmers <a href="crane-affair.html" class="wikilink">conspired to sell
damaged Cranes to Ikara</a>, violating a Pax embargo.</p>
<p>In 477, <a href="greyhound.html" class="wikilink">Greyhound</a>
completed their development of the <a href="aeromech.html"
class="wikilink">aeromech</a>. It was quickly discovered that aeromechs
offered adequate protection against locusts, and Goldwind purchased the
entire first production run (supported by <a href="ipro.html"
class="wikilink">IPRO</a>, who finally saw an end to the crisis in
sight). Existing pilots, having been trained to avoid swarms at all
costs, were unwilling to crew the aeromechs into overrun territory even
after watching their commanding officers return safely from doing the
same. An agreement was made with <a href="coachguard.html"
class="wikilink">Coachguard</a> to supply soldiers in exchange for half
of the stock of aeromechs.</p>
<p>Aeromechs proved to be extremely effective. Since both they and the
portable sprayers were able to run on substandard canisters, blue-grade
supply was able to fully support the reconstruction of farms and towns
as territory was cleared. By 485, locusts were effectively eradicated
from Tilia.</p>
<h2 id="aftermath">Aftermath</h2>
<p>In total, roughly one-quarter of Tilian towns were completely
destroyed. One third of those destroyed were rebuilt to a standardized
design, centered around five triplex compressors in a public square.
Many of these towns became popular destinations for displaced citizens,
accelerating the centralization of Tilian society.</p>
<p>The remaining aeromechs not sold to Coachguard were seized by Pax
authorities as part of the Crane Affair and were distributed to fire
departments internationally.</p>
