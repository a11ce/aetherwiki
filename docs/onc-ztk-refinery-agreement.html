        <h1 class="title">ONC-ZTK Refinery Agreement</h1>
                 </header>
        <p>The <strong>ONC–ZTK Refinery Agreement</strong> was a
long-term emerald air supply contract between the <a
href="ordossa-navigation-company.html" class="wikilink">Ordossa
Navigation Company</a> and the <a href="zalo-technical-kyro.html"
class="wikilink">Zalo Technical Kyro</a> signed in 418.</p>
<p>The agreement granted the ONC priority access to emerald air from
refineries owned by the ZTK. It additionally mandated that the ONC could
only import emerald air from the ZTK, and that the ZTK could not provide
emerald air to any other shipping company. This gave the ZTK a monopoly
on fuel supply for the largest shipping company in the world, and the
ONC the near-exclusive ability to operate high-speed ships running on
emerald fuel.</p>
<p>Following the exposure of the <a href="emerald-circuit.html"
class="wikilink">Emerald Circuit</a> smuggling operation, the ZTK fined
former ONC Deputy Captain Lucia Voroshin 300,000phi for document
forgery. They refused to abide by their exclusivity claude pending the
payment of the fine, arguing that they are entitled to recoup the losses
caused by the Circuit’s constructive violation of the agreement.</p>
<p>Voroshin vanished after her jail sentence in Marisa and the ONC is
unwilling to pay the fine on her behalf, so the agreement is considered
void de facto. The ONC continues to purchase part of their emerald air
supply from the ZTK.</p>
