        <p><strong>Phosgraphs</strong> are a long-range optical
communications system. They transmit colored light pulses within
stabilized ‘air tunnels’ between phosgraph towers. The light pulses are
recorded on photosensitive drums and read by operators.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<h3 id="static-pair-towers">Static-pair towers</h3>
<p>Phosgraphs were invented at <a href="tesser.html"
class="wikilink">Tesser</a> University in 24, as a development of pre-<a
href="enchantment.html" class="wikilink">Enchantment</a> signaling
systems based on shuttered lights. Two towers were installed, one at the
northern lighthouse and one on the roof of the House of Isles. These
towers had fixed inbound and outbound lenses, forming two fixed
unidirectional lanes. Only one lane could be active at a time due to
light bleed between nearby air tunnels. Other early towers had the same
static-pair configuration, and were mostly constructed by <a
href="stolmont.html" class="wikilink">Stolmont</a> and <a
href="marisa.html" class="wikilink">Marisa</a> in the <a
href="mirid-archipelago.html" class="wikilink">Mirid Archipelago</a> to
send messages between islands.</p>
<h3 id="network-scheduling">Network scheduling</h3>
<p>In 55, engineers in <a href="ercos.html" class="wikilink">Ercos</a>
developed a mechanism for the precise rotation of phosgraph lenses.
Since the lenses at each end of a lane had to be aligned for a message
to be sent, the Ercosian phosgraph line installed along the Whitewall
relied on a centralized schedule. For example, on even hours operators
would establish lanes A-B and C-D, then on odd hours lanes B-C and D-E.
During an even hour, the inbound operator at B would record messages
intended for C and then retransmit them during the next odd hour.</p>
<p><a href="roka.html" class="wikilink">Roka</a> developed cheap
dual-purpose lenses in 57, and the <a
href="ordossa-navigation-company.html" class="wikilink">Ordossa
Navigation Company</a> hired them to build single-lens towers across
Marisa and on ONC ports and offices across the world, implementing the
first non-linear scheduled network.</p>
<h3 id="relay-balloons">Relay balloons</h3>
<p>In 62, <a href="petrel.html" class="wikilink">Petrel Aerostatics</a>
introduced the relay balloon, a high-altitude platform for a
lens-and-mirror configuration able to bounce phosgraph pulses over the
horizon. These enabled cross-ocean phosgraph transmissions, and led to
the construction of phosgraph networks in <a href="kota.html"
class="wikilink">Kota</a>, <a href="qamar.html"
class="wikilink">Qamar</a>, and <a href="monnais.html"
class="wikilink">Monnais</a>.</p>
<p>These networks had a mix of public and private owners. Operators
working at the borders between networks often had to learn two protocols
and translate messages between them.</p>
<p>Relay balloons require calm water and building a network with perfect
lines of sight is infeasable. Manual delivery of messages between towers
is a common part of transmitting messages long-distance. This translated
into expensive and shifting connections between networks with different
owners as local courier services changed their prices.</p>
<h3 id="the-starlight-phosgraph-union">The Starlight Phosgraph
Union</h3>
<p>Network owners recognized that interoperability concerns could lead
to popular rejection of the technology. In order to standardize
protocols, operators across <a href="monnais.html"
class="wikilink">Monnais</a> and <a href="qamar.html"
class="wikilink">Qamar</a> founded the <a href="starlight.html"
class="wikilink">Starlight Phosgraph Union</a> in 78. In 81, Starlight
published its first bulletin. It contained the first attempt at an
international standard of pulse-encoding messages, a complete network
schedule for its members, and a cost-sharing procedure for manual
forwarding.</p>
<p>The <a href="ordossa-navigation-company.html"
class="wikilink">Ordossa Navigation Company</a> joined in 83 as the
owner of most towers in Marisa. Kota and Ercos continued to set their
own schedules for some time after the founding of Starlight. They
negotiated a shared schedule and standard for towers on their border,
effectively forming a coherent network.</p>
<p>After the <a href="locust-war.html" class="wikilink">Locust War</a>,
many <a href="tilia.html" class="wikilink">Tilian</a> towns were built
to include phosgraph towers. A Starlight branch office was opened in
Fog-Line Crossing, a Tilian frontier town, to coordinate these towers as
they came online. Ercos and most Kota kyros also joined Starlight in the
490s.</p>
