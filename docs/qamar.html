        <p>The <strong>Federative Union of Qamar</strong> is a country
in eastern <a href="itaan.html" class="wikilink">Itaan</a>. It borders
<a href="monnais.html" class="wikilink">Monnais</a> to the north, <a
href="arkand.html" class="wikilink">Arkand</a> to the south, and <a
href="delsin.html" class="wikilink">Delsin</a> to the southwest. The
Qamari region of the <a href="irim-desert.html" class="wikilink">Irim
Desert</a> is the only location of naturally occurring <a
href="aether-density.html" class="wikilink">emerald air</a>. Its capital
is Cadaz, a large coastal city home to the Qamar Historical Center.</p>
<p>Qamar has a population of approximately 35 million. Roughly 5 million
live aboard a few hundred landships in the Irim Desert with the
remainder residing in coastal and desert waypoint settlements.</p>
<h2 id="geography">Geography</h2>
<p>The <a href="irim-desert.html" class="wikilink">Irim Desert</a>, also
known as the Qamari Desert, covers most of western and southern Qamar.
Emerald air pockets appear at high altitudes over the Irim and are
visible as green and cyan atmospheric light. The border region with
Arkand is sparsely inhabited (except for <a href="nu-ayzen.html"
class="wikilink">Nu Ayzen</a>, a minor Qamari city) and the exact border
has historically been poorly defined.</p>
<p>Oasis towns are scattered throughout the Irim, many of which serve as
supply, repair, and waypoint stations for landships conducting
aether-collection operations.</p>
<h2 id="economy">Economy</h2>
<p>Much of Qamar’s economy is centered on the collection and export of
emerald air. Since the late first century, collection is undertaken by
town-sized landships that travel the Irim Desert following aether
pockets. Landships operate scout planes to track the movement of emerald
concentrations and tethered aerostats equipped with industrial
compressors. The collected aether is pumped into tanks on the landship
then taken to port towns for sale to brokers, who then export
internationally.</p>
<h2 id="landships">Landships</h2>
<p>Qamari landships are self-contained mobile communities, each
functioning as an autonomous town. A typical landship houses five to ten
thousand residents and contains housing facilities, maintenance
workshops, and commercial spaces such as shops, restaurants, and
swordball courts.</p>
<p>Each landship is internally self-governing, typically run by a
council or captain-led administration. Landship governments maintain
their own treasuries funded by taxing aether sales and are responsible
for their own operational costs. Laws regarding ownership of on-board
property vary. Some landships allow private leasing, while others
directly operate their own collection operations or residential
facilities.</p>
<p>Most landships dock at oasis towns every few weeks for water, food,
and repairs, and at coastal export cities at least once every season.
Some landships are built for extremely high autonomy and can survive for
months in the western Irim with no external contact.</p>
<h2 id="government-and-politics">Government and Politics</h2>
<p>In practice, individual landships and oasis towns are largely
self-governing, with the federal government working to coordinate the
use of shared national infrastructure and directly administering some
coastal cities.</p>
<p>The Qamari Federal Air Service is a semi-militarized civil service
agency. The Air Service conducts weather and communications patrols
between oasis towns and landships and maintains a capable fleet of
combat aircraft. Cooperation between landship security forces and the
Air Service is limited, and Qamar does not otherwise have a standing
army.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Pre-<a href="enchantment.html" class="wikilink">Enchantment</a> Qamar
was characterized by coastal trading cities and desert convoys to
Monnais and Arkand.</p>
<p>After the Enchantment, it was observed that the lights over the Irim
Desert persisted long after they had disappeared elsewhere. <a
href="wizard.html" class="wikilink">Wizards</a> in oasis towns soon
noticed that <a href="aetherpower.html" class="wikilink">aetherpower</a>
effectiveness increased when the lights were overhead. Early attempts to
harvest this air made use of stationary aerostats, often positioned
according to the predictions of wizards. This proved to be very
inefficient, and later aetherists have determined that the wizards
likely had no special insight into future pocket locations.</p>
<p>Throughout the 20s and 30s, former desert convoy traders began
experimenting with mobile collection. Early “landships” were converted
supply wagons drawn either by sail or camel. By the 50s, following the
invention of aetheric engines and the subsequent price increase of
emerald air, the first true landships were constructed. Over the
following decades, these early prototypes were replaced by moving
towns.</p>
