        <h1 class="title">Syndicate Accords</h1>
                 </header>
        <p>The <strong>Syndicate Accords</strong> formalized the
de-facto status of the <a href="arkand.html"
class="wikilink">Arkandic</a> syndicates as the ruling power of the
country. They are the constitutional documents of the modern state of
Arkand.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>In 51 BE, the King of Arkand died with no living heirs, and a number
of royal houses positioned to start a war of succession. The interim
government, the Provincial Council of Crown and Estates, placated them
by leasing exclusive charters of responsibility for functions of the
Crown. The Council later located the King’s only ‘son’, who had been
presumed dead, living in Delsin Station. She was crowned in absentia,
but never returned to Arkand.</p>
<p>Throughout the next 20 years, these charter companies grew beyond
their mandates and outcompeted other firms without the weight of a royal
house behind them. By 30 BE, most charter companies held monopolies over
vast swaths of the economy. The companies began to issue their own
currency, provide housing, and write their own laws, effectively
becoming parallel states within Arkand with citizenship determined by
employment.</p>
<p>The Council, still the official government in nominal expectation of
the Queen’s return, recognized their inability to contest this process.
In 10 BE, they instructed the royal courts to respect the laws and
judgements of so-called charter governments and adjudicate only in cases
of disagreements between charter companies.</p>
<p>In the first decade after the <a href="enchantment.html"
class="wikilink">Enchantment</a>, many members of the Arkandic royal
family visited the nearby Qamar Library and were told of the
revolutionary potential of <a href="aetherpower.html"
class="wikilink">aetherpower</a>. They facilitated a series of meetings
between the heads of charter companies in order to officially relinquish
state power in hopes that Arkand would become the dominant empire in the
new age of aether.</p>
<h2 id="the-conclaves-of-charterholders">The Conclaves of
Charterholders</h2>
<p>The first conclave was held in 11. It established a fixed exchange
rate between company currencies and the right of citizens to seek
employment outside of their current company. The Arkand Housing
Commission was established to determine a process for doing away with
single-company towns.</p>
<p>The second Conclave was held in 18. The increased mutual recognition
created by the first conclave was generally considered successful, as
was the purchase of most residences by the Housing Commission. After two
weeks of negotiation, the council and heads of each charter company
signed the Syndicate Accords, a series of documents reconstituting the
government of Arkand.</p>
<h2 id="terms-of-the-accords">Terms of the Accords</h2>
<p>The Accords recharted existing companies as syndicates, sectoral
monopolies affiliated with (but not neccessarily owned by) the state.
The Syndicate Board took the place of the Council and royal courts,
adjudicating disagreements and determining foreign policy by voting. In
practice, Board issues are resolved through trading resources, favors,
or information between the Syndicates.</p>
<p>Some syndicates were created, restructured, or expanded by the
accords. For example, the policing and paramilitary forces of each
charter company were distributed among the Maritime Union, Combined
Security Syndicate and Army Directorate. Likewise, the Housing
Commission was absorbed by the Stratis Corporation, which had previously
been the owner of the railway system.</p>
<p>The syndicates as established by the accords are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aetheric Research Organization, employs wizards and techniciansto do
aetherics research as hired by other syndicates</li>
