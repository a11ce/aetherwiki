An **aeromechanic vehicle** (also called **aeromech**, **mech**, or **Schreitfahrzeug**) is a pulse-driven legged vehicle powered by compressed aether. Aeromechs use discrete pulses controlled by direct mechanical pressure latches to extend and retract linear joints. This makes them reliable in adverse environments, and allowed them to be much smaller than contemporary (pre-[[CRP]]) wheeled or tracked vehicles.

Aeromechs were developed by [[Greyhound]] during the 470s. The first model produced, designated ASfz-7E, was intended to be sold to Ercos in 477 for border patrol outside the Whitewall. During trials, it was discovered that positively-pressurized aeromechs protected against locust attack, so the order was taken over by [[Goldwind]] with financial backing from [[IPRO]]. Some ASfz-7Es were later transferred to [[Coachguard-Nord]] and the rest were seized by Pax authorities in connection with the [[Crane Affair]].

ASfz-7Es have four legs and carry a crew of three: pilot, engineer, and commander. Later models include the ASfz-12 six-leg artillery platform and ASfz-36 ten-leg troop carrier. Other models, such as amphibious and cargo variants, were produced for civilian export.

other ground vehicles are massive (landships) so pre-crp this is the only car-ish-sized way to go. look at a Boxer IFV and imagine it has legs. also since greyhound loves to export everything, assume that there are a ton of variants including whatever youre thinking of
