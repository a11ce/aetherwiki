title: "Aether Density"
---

**Aether density** refers to a standardized grading scale of aethercompression as measured by a densimeter. It was invented in 378 at the [[Nordovest Institute]].

- Blue is the reference grade. It is the density produced by a [[triplex compressor]] in normal conditions.
- Gold is high grade. It is produced by larger industrial compressors and replaces previous proprietary standards. For example, the [[Northwind Rail]] pipeline uses Gold 6, formerly known as Ercos C.
- Emerald is anything at or above Gold 10. It is produced only in [[Qamar]] and [[Kota]] to individual specification.
- Gray refers to any aether density below blue.
