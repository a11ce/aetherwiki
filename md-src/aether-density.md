**Aether density** refers to a scale of aethercompression as measured by a [[densimeter]]. The following standardized grades were formalized in 378 at the [[Nordovest Institute]]:

- Blue is the reference grade. It is the density produced by a [[triplex compressor]] in normal conditions.
- Gold is high grade. It is produced by larger industrial compressors and replaces previous proprietary standards. For example, the [[Northwind Rail]] pipeline uses Gold 6, formerly known as Ercos C.
- Emerald is anything at or above Gold 10. It is produced only in [[Qamar]] and [[Kota]] to individual specification.
- Gray refers to any aether density below blue.

blue is also produced industrially, especially in kota. emerald is used for high-precision magic and also planes. a key economic thing is that even in places that produce gold/emerald, it's cheaper to sell it and buy blue
