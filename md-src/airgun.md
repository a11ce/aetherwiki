An **airgun** is a device that propels a projectile, such as a pellet or spike, using air pressure. Early airguns were manually pressurized before each shot by a mechanism such as a level or bolt. Since the early 300s, most airguns run on replaceable multi-shot [[cartridges|aether storage]]. 

Notable airgun manufacturers include [[Nokari]] and Cobra Armaments.
