it's partially economic, theyre wizards who are devalued by aetherpower automation. but also the vosanite refineries and some other industrial compression sites are really rough places. theyre kind of luddites for all the luddite reasons

there's kind of an ecological element but industrial aerocompression is not really that bad for the environment. it's unclear whether [[beast]]s are created by industrial compression or ambient exposure or something? but theyre usually like. on the side of beasts versus ppl trying to do experiments on them
