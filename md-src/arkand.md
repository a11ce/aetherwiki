## Society and Government

Each major commercial and public sector in Arkand is controlled by a vertically integrated syndicate. These syndicates have their own internal governance and exercise complete control over their domains. Other firms such as companies or government offices are owned by multiple syndicates as a way of organizing collaboration.

The Syndicate Board is a national body of represenatives from each syndicate. They agree on foreign and monetary policy for all of Arkand. Board negotiations are famously transactional.

Notable syndicates include the Stratis Corporation (in charge of civilian aether infrastructure), the Combined Security Syndicate, the Maritime Union, and the Army Directorate.
