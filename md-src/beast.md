A **beast** is an animal that has apparently been changed in some way by exposure to aethercompressed air. Not much is known about them. 

They are a subject of ongoing research at the [[Nordovest Institute]]. Their containment and management is the main task of the [[Ikaran Park Service]] and a secondary concern of the [[Zalo Technical Kyro]].

## Notable types of beast

it's purposefully unclear how beasts are created. there are populations of beasts that are similar so it's probably often a species-level type mutation thing but there are also unique ones. some are dangerous (like aggressive bear-size things) but most of them are cute and silly
