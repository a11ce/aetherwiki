A **beast** is an animal that has apparently been changed in some way by exposure to aethercompressed air. Various kinds of beasts are found across the world.

They are a subject of ongoing research at the [[Nordovest Institute]]. Their containment and management is the main task of the [[Ikaran Park Service]] and a secondary concern of the [[Zalo Technical Kyro]].
