title: "Black-Air Conflict"

period of unrest in [[kota]], 428-431. Kota feels shortchanged bc they've become a valuable producer of emerald air (only producer other than [[Qamar]]) but [[Pax|pax centralis]] refuses to pay them more for it (the initial payment schedule treats all regulated air as blue). 

A refinery in Qime leaks dangerous gas and Pax mandates a shutdown while [[LCA|liara canal authority]] engineers come and do safety inspections. This leads to mass unrest and militias blockading the procurate building in Kota City. 

- pax tries to break the procurate building siege but when they regain sight into Kota it's clear this isnt something that can be solved by force
- pax governance is renegotiated to form the modern oversight council
- constitution is amended to price air by density
- IPRO waives levies on relief ships (partially leading to [[lock 19 blockade]])
