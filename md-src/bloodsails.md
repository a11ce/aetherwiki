The **Bloodsails** are a loose gang of pirates who broke away from [[Ikara]] in the 280s, after the [[Corsair Uprising]].

Many of them are based on small islands in [[Etalameri]].

They were hired by and then subsumed into the Monnais Navy during the [[Ribbon War]].

they harass ships passing through the etalameri sea route and are in conflict with the ikara coast guard. when ikara is unstable (happens,, ,kind of often) a lot of trade is forced through liara which can raise prices and generally mess with the economy
