title: "Blue-stripe Levy"

standard levy taken by [[IPRO]] as of 413 when a [[blue-grade|aether density]] barrel crosses a border. the density is checked and a blue stripe is applied to the valve which will be rubbed off when the barrel is used

10% goes to IPRO operations, 20% goes to crisis stockpile, 70% goes to local govt

```

foreign countries allow this bc the 20% is like an international insurance scheme and bc offloading all the densimeter/certification stuff to IPRO is efficient bc they have the cutting edge NVI anti-counterfeit tech
