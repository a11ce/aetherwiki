The **Boreal ice cutters** are a guild of explorers and technicians who harvest [[low-background ice|aether density]] from [[Cerevis]] and coordinate its global export. Scattered operations began in 249 and the guild swas founded in 251. [[Coachguard Nord]] is contracted annually for protection from Cerevis raiders.

the ice bridge between monnais and cerevis is seasonal and so are the expeditions. coachguard nord is able to truce with some tribes but it's tough bc theyre unpredictably nomadic and politically unstable

ice war!
