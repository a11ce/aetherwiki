**Cerevis** is the northern polar region. It borders [[Monnais]] and [[Liara]] to the south. It is inhabited by ten Cerevisiaen tribes whose territories are roughly longitudinally divided.

## Cerevisiaen tribes

Cerevisiaens are nomadic within their longitudinal territories, traveling north and south with the seasons. They make use of [[rogsleds|rog]] for transport and supply.

From east to west (clockwise on a polar map), the tribes are: Fish, Bind, Peek, Atvash, Hecta, Sonebul, Sina, Rino, Ara, and Bash.
