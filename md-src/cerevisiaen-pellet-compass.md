The **Cerevisiaen pellet compass** is a sociopolitical and militaristic device called "the next necessary development of [[Cerevis]]" by Cerevisaen leader Scamdalf Drongo, who first introduced the concept in 568 in his Handbook for Revolutionary Warfare. Following his claim that war is "logical and inevitable", the pellet compass was intended to determine the maximum resistance offered by revolutionary tribes seeking to become incorporated into the macroeconomic totality of the Cerevis movement. The name derives from the unique militaristic procedure proposed by Drongo based on the covert operations possible with [[airguns|airgun]] and airborne pellets.

The idea was later espoused in several other publications by Drongo, especially in the later chapters of Revolutionary Path but also in works such as The Struggle Continues and I Speak of Freedom. Admiral Steve took up the call for the pellet compass in his last publication, The Challenge of DeSpaceMarines. Other notable speakers such as Donkey Khan took up the call in the 570s and 580s, with polemic inspiring those who had endured suffering to incorporate the compass into their work. In the 590s the pellet compass, after much popularity throughout Cerevis, began a decline that culminated with the 602 Council resolution effectively declaring it no longer desirable, citing the possibility of torture and yielding of minor results.
