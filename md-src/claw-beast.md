**Claw Beasts** are [[beasts|beast]] commonly found in and around the eastern side of the [[White River Forest]]. They are extremely aggressive and frequently attack metal structures for unknown reasons. Claw Beasts are 1.5 meters tall and 2.5 meters long.

The [[Ikaran Park Service]] is tasked with the containment of Claw Beasts. Between 497 and 502, the IPS was pulled away to serve as an internal security force, leading to the abandonment and Claw Beast takeover of several towns and two major train lines in western Ikara. After the Civil Revolt, the IPS, led by Commander Silva, fought to retake the lost territory.
