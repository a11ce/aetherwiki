**Coachguard** is an international logistics security company specializing in convoy escort, route protection, and airborne rapid response. It is headquartered in [[Ternmouth]].

## History 

Coachguard was founded as the Coach and Rail Guard in 180 as a loose organization of mercenaries in Tilia available for hire from a central office. It quickly became popular among transport drivers, and won a large contract from [[Northwind Rail]] in 218. It incorporated as Coachguard in 224.

Coachguard supplied soldiers during the [[Locust War]] as aeromech crews. They were given half of Goldwind's aeromech stock in 477 and assigned them to [[Coachguard Nord]] in 489.

## Organization

Coachguard operates several divisions:

- Coachguard Rail is specfically tasked with Northwind Rail security.
- Coachguard Aviation operates light aircraft.
- Coachguard Gold is an unadvertised direct action division.
- Coachguard Nord is a Monnais subsidiary. It commonly runs security for [[Boreal Ice Cutters]].

tilia basically outsources their military to these guys, there's like 50k of them

they actually do specialize in protective actions but are definitely capable of outright warfare

also i am now realizing that i forgot to add the division that just does other contracts for hire. that exists too. they also kept some aeromechs and otherwise ride horses or ride along in whatever theyre guarding (usually wheeled trains)
