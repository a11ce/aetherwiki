A **densimeter** is a device used to measure [[aether density]]. 

Early densimeters were developed in the 230s at the [[Nordovest Institute]]. They were room-sized instruments that compared aether pressure against a large filtered reference tank. Portable densimeters, invented in 249, make use of low-background water collected by [[boreal ice cutters]].

aether density is weird. it doesnt go down as the gas inside a container is released, and it somehow produces more physical force than it should
