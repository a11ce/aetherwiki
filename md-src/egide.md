**Egide** (*eh-ZHEED*) is a [[Monnais]] private military and security company. They specialize in aggressive small-unit operations and, under Monnais' private security laws, frequently work work alongside (or in place of) canton police. They also act as advisors to the [[IPRO]] Enforcement Team.

Egide traces its lineage to former members of the royal guard who defected during the [[Wizard Revolution]], and Egide squads are named for revolutionary companies. Squads commonly carry the banners of their namesakes, sometimes claiming direct continuity. Egide soldiers are also issued sabers of the type used by the royal army during the Revolution. They are mostly ceremonial. Egide is controversial in Monnais for its usage of royal aesthetics and a perceived pro-wizard bias when selecting officers. 

## Notable operations

- Breaking of the [[Lock 19 Blockade]] (alleged, disputed by Egide)
- Arrest of Voroshin during the investigation of the [[Emerald Circuit]]
