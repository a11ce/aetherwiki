The **Enchantment** was a global metereological event that marks Year 0 of the modern calendar. For several weeks, extraordinarily strong persistent auroras were visible in the night sky around the world. Soon after, early [[aetheric|aetherpower]] scientists, who would later be known as [[wizards|wizard]], discovered that the atmosphere now contained aether, a substance usable for mechanical and semantic power.
