title: "Ercos"

[[Ercos]] appears to most [[Pax|Pax centralis]] citizens only as its border wall, an impossibly long cliff of iron stretching from the northwest to the southwest corner of [[Lanteen]], and curving into the sea at each side. Off the western shore, massive ice sheets prevent any entry by sea and send frigid winds into Ercos. The border wall was created in part as an artificial mountain to further lower the temperature in order to maximize industrial and human efficiency.
