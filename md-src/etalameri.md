**Etalameri** is a sea south of [[Lanteen]]. It contains many islands owned by [[Ikara]], some of which are home to [[Bloodsail|Bloodsails]] fleets.

this maybe doesnt need to have its own name tbh. the south pole is uninhabitable ice so etalameri is really just like the water around the island part of ikara

but it is important for the same reason as [[cormorant strait]]
