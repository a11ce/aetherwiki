**Frantim** are [[beasts|beast]] commonly found across the [[Tilian|tilia]] plains and the [[Irim Desert]]. Frantim have a hard exoskeleton, two legs, and two arm-like front appendages. They are roughly one meter long and 60 cm tall when fully grown. 

Frantim have the unique property of responding to [[aetherpower]] semantics. When exposed to glyphed air, frantim will attempt to carry out the described task. This behavior was instrumental in early explorations of aetherpower carried out by the Tilian Royal Laboratory for Cognitive Science.
