**Goldwind Agricultural Cooperative** is a [[Tilian|Tilia]] farmer cooperative specializing in the production of crop dusters equipment from used low-grade bulk cartridges.

Before the founding of Goldwind, individual farms would commonly hire [[wizards|wizard]] to spray fertilizer and pest repellent.

Founded in 458 by 4 farms that purchase a triplex compressor to refill low-grade skystone tanks. Use planes to spray fertilizer/repellent. See [[Locust War]].
