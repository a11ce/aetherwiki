*This page is written for potential players of Starlight: 515, so it will not mention anything after that year. Starlight: 515 branches into an alternate timeline and there is no expectation for it to remain consistent with post-515 events on the wiki.*

## Aether

Aether is a substance that appeared in the air after the [[Enchantment]]. It amplifies the physical force of compressed air beyond what is normally possible, and has semantically-determined effects when put into specific shapes. See [[Aetherpower]].

Soon after the Enchantment, individuals ([[wizards|wizard]]) learned to control the semantic aspects of aetherpower. This was quite dangerous to learn, but simple spells could be replicated and taught easily. Wizards became economically and socially indispensible. Additionally, some countries (such as [[Arkand]] and [[Ercos]]) began to industrially produce compressed air and explore the industrial applications of mechanical aetherpower.

In 346, the [[triplex compressor]] was invented, a windmill-like compressor that can fill consumer-size canisters. This kickstarted a sort of industrial revolution, and aetherpower is used as ubiquitously as electricity or the combustion engine (neither of which exist in aetherworld). Generally as of 515, the cultural and tech level is between 1850-1920 depending on the region.

## Countries

There are two continents: Lanteen (west) and Itaan (east). (The world is a sphere, east and west is how they appear on standard world maps).

- In southern Itaan
- Extremely industrialized
- Governed by a Board of vertical syndicates, see [[syndicate accords]]
- Generally somewhat aggressive/warlike, has spies everywhere

#### [[Delsin]]

- Autonomous region of Stolmont
- Libertarian research center anarchy

#### [[Ercos]]

- Freezing cold industrial-optimization zone
- Largest producer of blue (standard grade) air
- Centrally planned economy, generally isolationist

#### [[Ikara]]

- southeast bit of lanteen and nearby islands
- Civil service democracy
- Former colony of Arkand, tumultuous history
- Current de-facto prime minister really hates [[beast]]s

#### [[Kogane]]

- Isolated island nation west of delsin
- See [[Nine Knot War]]

#### [[Kota]]

- southwest bit of lanteen
- Notable for industrially refining air into emerald (highest-grade)
- opaque politics (because i havent figured out how they work)

#### [[Liara]]

- very rich city-state in the cormorant strait (venice vibes), which is the west-east passing in northern lanteen
- known for the cormorant lock system 
- formerly part of Tilia, still very friendly and ruled by a branch of their royal family

#### [[Lusquo]]

- tiny island nation east of liara that exists mostly to get reversed-falklands'd like 200 years after this game takes place

#### [[Marisa]]

- also kind of tiny but also the home of the largest shipping company in the world

#### [[Monnais]]

- like if revolutionary france stuck with it
- northern 1/3rd ish of itaan

#### [[Qamar]]

#### [[tilia]]

- east coast is roaring 20s art deco, rest is old west frontier
- technically a monarchy but the monarch doesnt get involved in day-to-day governance and historically privatizes a lot of stuff

#### [[Cerevis]]

- not a country; north pole region with various tribes that nobody really knows much about
- currently being united by Ataya "Scamdalf" Drongo

## Other notable groups

- [[Antipressure front]]: against industrial aethercompression 
- [[bloodsails]]: broke away from ikara after the ikaran revolution bc they didnt like centralization
- [[Nordovest Institute]]: aetheric/technical research center, lots of wizards
- [[starlight phosgraph union]]: in-setting telegrams/mail/newspaper
- [[acuto]]: major international bank from Liara
- [[ordossa navigation company]]: giant shipping company, captains have a lot of independence
