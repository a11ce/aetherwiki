IPRO is a [[Pax|pax centralis]]-based international regulatory agency founded in 236 after two compressor explosions were linked to mislabelled pressure vessels. 

IPRO was initially tasked with issuing pressure certificates upon densimeter inspection of barrels. This was done at the [[Nordovest Institute]] Pressure Lab in [[Liara]] on request by transiting ships. These paper certificates were affixed to the outside of barrels, and were often illegally kept when the barrel was refilled. This ad-hoc system was acceptable for the time; firms importing barrels for pressure-critical operations would send a represenative to Liara to attend the pressure certification and then accompany the shipment to its destination. By 340, several other nations had signed on to the governing treaty.

The widespread adoption of [[triplex compressors|triplex compressor]] was initially thought to render pressure certification obsolete: triplex compressors fill a standardized container with air of a standard pressure. This was proven wrong in 410, when counterfeit triplex-compressed containers flooded the [[Itaan]] market, leading to numerous fatal accidents. In response, the IPRO Board proposed the [[blue-stripe levy]] to the Pax senate. After some negotiation regarding the distribution of funds, it got full Pax support and was effectively made law in 413. 

Every nation except [[Lusquo]], [[Delsin]], and [[Cerevis]] joined by 450. todo full timeline

The IPRO Oversight Team works with local inspectors. They wear sky-blue vests. 

Since 431, IPRO also has an Enforcement Team. They accompany Oversight officers or conduct independent action. They were trained and initially led by [[Egide]]. Half of the ET is permanently stationed in Liara.
