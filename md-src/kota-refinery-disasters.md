The **Vosanite Refinery Disasters** were a series of accidents at [[vosanite]] refineries in the late 420s and early 430s, including a waste spill in Qime in 428 and a tank overpressure explosion in Vosa in 431.

### Qime

In 428, a catastrophic process failure in the Qime refinery complex led to a 6 hour uncontrolled venting of refinement by-product gas, known as 'black air'. The town of Qime was evacuated and the area is still uninhabitable. 

[[IPRO]] activated relief protocols, suspending levies on air, food, and medical supplies bound for nearby ports. The [[Pax|pax centralis]] council ordered all vosanite refineries to be shut down until [[LCA|liara canal authority]] were able to inspect them. This order was largely ignored, and conflicts between Pax officials and refinery workers spiraled into a period of mass civil unrest, later called the [[Black Air Conflict]].


### Vosa

In 431, an emerald storage tank at the Vosa train station exploded. The blast and ensuing fire destroyed several tanker trains in a nearby yard and killed over 600 rail workers and residents of Vosa. Pax officials blamed the accident on refineries illegally operating above quota. IPRO extended its relief terms to the entire western region of Kota, predicting an economic crisis. This was cited by Nicolas Ducco as a motivation for the [[Lock 19 Protest|lock 19 blockade]].
