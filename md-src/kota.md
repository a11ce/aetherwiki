kota has a weird economic system that i havent completely figured out yet. a kyro is like a multinational corporation that owns a lot of different things in different industries except theyre not multinational and also are somewhat like royal houses? like the members of a kyro usually vote as a bloc at least?

a bit like arkand except horizontal slices of industry instead of vertical? but not really horizontal it's just kinda whatever. the vibe is supposed to be a sort of warring states thing? but less violent. but still pretty violent
