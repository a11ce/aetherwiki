The **Liara Canal Authority** is a state-owned corporation in [[Liara]].

It was founded in 202 under the Pax Canal Authority Act. The Act also transferred ownership of the canal locks from the crown to the LCA. In the mid 300s, struggling to keep up with increased trade, LCA began to sell individual locks into private ownership. International ownership was allowed starting in 431 in response to the [[Lock 19 Blockade]].

Subgroups include Inspection Corps (works alongside [[IPRO]] to collect levies), Safety Corps, and Engineer Corps.
