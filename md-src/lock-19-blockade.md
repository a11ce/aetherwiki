title: "Lock 19 Blockade"

The **Lock 19 Blockade** (also known as the **Lock 19 Protest**) was a canal blockade in 431 by Liaran sovereigntists over perceived [[IPRO]] overreach in the wake of the [[Qime refinery disaster|kota refinery disasters]].

## Background 

todo talk about the [[black air conflict]] and Qime

After the Qime refinery disaster, IRPO activated relief protocols, suspending levies on air, food, and construction materials bound for affected regions in [[Kota]]. 

## Blockade 

Liaran [[sovereigntists|sovereigntism]] led by Nicolas Ducco, part owner of Lock 19, conspired with the captain of Fir to block the entrance to Lock 19. In later criminal trials, they stated that they intended to negotiate for partial levies or some compensation by IPRO, and did not expect any violence. They also stated a desire to demonstrate the sovereignty of Liara but not to actually block relief to Kota.

## Seizure

Two days after the start of the blockade, three teams of soldiers wearing blue IPRO vests seized the two lock 19 control towers and the Fir. 

IPRO does not have a standing militarized division, and these soldiers have not been definitively identified. When interviewed, Ducco claimed that they spoke [[Monnéen|Monnais]] and suggested that they were hired from [[Egide]]. This is disputed by Égide.

Cooperative Liaran engineers were brought in under IPRO guard to operate all locks for the duration of the relief effort.

## Aftermath

IPRO creates [[enforcement team|Ipro]], 20 operators and 4 patrol boats. Half of ET is stationed in Liara.

Criminal prosecution of Ducco and other sovereigntists resulting in forced sale of lock 19, ultimately to [[Pantheon]].

Liaran cabinet votes 5-4 to rescind from closed locks agreement under IPRO military pressure.

## Alleged Foreign Involvement

It is unclear how the captain of Fir was able to convince his crew to go along with the plan. The ship was an ONC vessel from [[Arkand]] to [[Stolmont]]. The crew was based in arkand.
