The **Lock 19 Blockade** (also known as the **Lock 19 Protest**) was a canal blockade in 431 by Liaran sovereigntists over perceived [[IPRO]] overreach in the wake of the [[Qime refinery disaster|kota refinery disasters]].

## Background 

todo talk about the [[black air conflict]] and Qime

After the Qime refinery disaster, IPRO activated relief protocols, suspending levies on air, food, and construction materials bound for affected regions in [[Kota]]. 

## Blockade 

Liaran [[sovereigntists|sovereigntism]] led by Nicolas Ducco, part owner of Lock 19, conspired with the captain of the ONC Fir to block the entrance to Lock 19. The Fir dropped its anchor while in the chamber of the lock, refusing to leave when the exit gate was opened. 

In later criminal trials, they stated that they intended to negotiate for partial levies or some compensation by IPRO, and did not expect any violence. They also stated a desire to demonstrate the sovereignty of Liara but not to actually block relief to Kota.

## Seizure

Two days after the start of the blockade, three teams of soldiers wearing blue IPRO vests seized the two lock 19 control towers and the Fir. 

IPRO does not have a standing militarized division, and these soldiers have not been definitively identified. 

Cooperative LCA engineers were brought in under IPRO guard to operate all locks for the duration of the relief effort.

## Aftermath

IPRO creates [[enforcement team|Ipro]], 20 operators and 4 patrol boats provided by Egide with the intent to train a larger force. Half of IPRO-ET is permanently stationed in Liara.

Criminal prosecution of Ducco and other sovereigntists resulting in forced sale of lock 19, ultimately to [[Pantheon]].

Captain and crew of the Fir repatriated to Arkand.

## Alleged Foreign Involvement

It is unclear what motivated the captain and crew of the Fir to go along with this plan. The private intelligence firm [[Mariposa]] has alleged that at least some of them were Arkandic Combined Security Syndicate agents posing as ONC sailors.

When interviewed, Ducco claimed that the IPRO soldiers spoke [[Monn√©en|Monnais]] and suggested that they were hired from [[Egide]]. This is disputed by Egide.
