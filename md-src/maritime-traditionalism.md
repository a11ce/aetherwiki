**Maritime-traditionalism** is, among other beliefs, the view that national territorial claims on water are illegitimate. It arose in the 200s in [[Ercos]], partially as a result of increasing escort and filing fees charged by [[Arkand]] to ships sailing through [[Ikaran|Ikara]] waters.

It caught on in [[Kogane]] in the 220s, leading to the formation of the [[Wake Society]], the Lantong Plaza Incident, and ultimately the [[Nine Knot War]].

Maritime-traditionalism is commonly linked to the concept of self-governing ports practiced in [[Monnais]]. They are different in that maritime-traditionalism focuses on passage and transit, and self-governing ports are mostly relevant to import inspections and taxes.
