**Monnais**, officially the **Monnais Republic**, is a country located in northern [[Itaan]]. It borders [[Cerevis]] to the north, [[Delsin]] to the southwest and [[Qamar]] to the south. Its capital is [[Montrevieux]].

## History

- Pre-Enchantment: Consolidation of various states under a single crown
- 52: [[Wizard Revolution]] ends, Republic established
- [[Ribbon War]]

## Society and Government

Monnais is a parliamentary republic. The 300-seat Popular Assembly is elected every 5 years. The Assembly is directed by a Presidium of 6 delegates.

Monnais is divided into 7 cantons, roughly corresponding to to the territories of pre-consolidation royal states. Each canton is responsible for local taxation and law enforcement. 

As a legacy of the extensive system of royal titles in use before the Wizard Revolution, Monnais has a culture of non-governmental awards which confer prestige. For example, Theo Koli became a celebrity overnight after winning the Agricultural Academy Grand Prize in 464 for his invention of EpiNou wheat.
