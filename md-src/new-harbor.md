New Harbor is the capital of [[Tilia]]. It is located on the eastern coast, north of the mouth of Fox River. New Harbor is known for its extensive offshore seaweed farms. Seaweed is processed into food and fertilizer and exported to frontier farms. The [[Fox River Shipyard]] is located just south of New Harbor.
