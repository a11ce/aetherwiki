**Northwind Rail** is an [[Ercosian|Ercos]] transport company with lines across all Pax nations. 

They licensed [[laminated pipe|skystone]] technology from [[Helix Dynamics]] in 668, and laid pipes below existing rail lines to power ultra-light high speed trains.

They were involved in the [[Ribbon War]] in 735 fighting alongside Arkand when Monnais rescinds their CRP license and attempts to recapture or destroy CRP-based trains.
