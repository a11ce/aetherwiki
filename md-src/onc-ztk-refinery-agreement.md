The **ONCâ€“ZTK Refinery Agreement** was a long-term emerald air supply contract between the [[Ordossa Navigation Company]] and the [[Zalo Technical Kyro]] signed in 418.

The agreement granted the ONC priority access to emerald air from refineries owned by the ZTK. It additionally mandated that the ONC could only import emerald air from the ZTK, and that the ZTK could not provide emerald air to any other shipping company. This gave the ZTK a monopoly on fuel supply for the largest shipping company in the world, and the ONC the near-exclusive ability to operate high-speed ships running on emerald fuel.

Following the exposure of the [[Emerald Circuit]] smuggling operation, the ZTK fined former ONC Deputy Captain Lucia Voroshin 300,000phi for document forgery. They refused to abide by their exclusivity clause pending the payment of the fine, arguing that they are entitled to recoup the losses caused by the Circuit's constructive violation of the agreement.

Voroshin vanished after her jail sentence in Marisa and the ONC is unwilling to pay the fine on her behalf, so the agreement is considered void de facto. The ONC continues to purchase part of their emerald air supply from the ZTK.
