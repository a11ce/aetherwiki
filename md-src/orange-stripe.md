**Orange Stripe** is an [[IPRO]] designation (sometimes a literal orange stripe painted on vehicles, equipment, or aether containers) for items subsidized by IPRO's crisis stockpile. The serial numbers for all orange stripe items are published by IPRO to assist in tracing misplaced disaster relief supplies. It was established in 481 in response to the [[Crane Affair]].
