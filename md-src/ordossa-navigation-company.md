ONC fleet captains own their ships and accept jobs at each port. often jobs are periodic so they can have a steady repeating route, but some prefer to take whatever is best each time. ONC fleets have a number of permanent officers hired by the captain, and regular crews are hired by local ONC offices and operate basically on a gig system (in terms of allocation on journeys, but they work for and are paid a standard rate by the ONC)
