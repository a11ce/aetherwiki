The **Pax Centralis** is a supranational economic and military alliance founded in 157. Pax began as a free trade agreement between [[Liara]] and [[Tilia]] after the [[Liaran Secession]]. and later expanded to include [[Kota]] (in 287) and [[Ercos]] (in 406).

The [[Liara Canal Authority]] and [[International Pressure Regulation Organization|IPRO]] are both incorporated under Pax jurisdiction.

[[Kota]] joined Pax in 287 in order to export surplus crops to Tilia without tariffs. A failed renegotiation regarding export pricing of [[Vosanite]]-refined air and multiple refinery disasters lead to the [[Black Air Conflict]] in 428.

Piracy and raids from Cerevis in the 390s lead to the Cormorant Security Protocol in 400, giving Pax government the ability to requisition and command the militaries of its member states.

[[Ercos]] joined in 406 after some really bad piracy happens or something.
