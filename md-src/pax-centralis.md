The **Pax Centralis** is a supranational economic and military alliance founded in 157. It began as a free trade agreement between [[Liara]] and [[Tilia]] and has expanded to include [[Kota]] and [[Ercos]].


## Governance

The authority of Pax is divided into four offices: Diplomacy, Industry, Culture, and State. The heads of the offices are elected by delegates from member states every two years. Its law enforcement agency, the [[Pax Marshals Bureau]], is part of the Office of State, but command is traditionally shared between the offices.

Since 433, an Oversight Council of 3 representatives from each member state supervise the application of Pax regulations.

Both the [[Liara Canal Authority]] and the [[International Pressure Regulation Organization|ipro]] are considered to represent the authority of Pax despite being incorporated as state-owned firms in Liara and Tilia respectively.

Since 400, the Cormorant Security Protocol authorizes Pax to request and command member military assets for defense and anti-piracy patrols. The Diplomacy and State offices jointly administer CSP operations.
