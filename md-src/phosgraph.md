**Phosgraphs** are a long-range optical communications system. They transmit colored light pulses within stabilized 'air tunnels' between phosgraph towers. Tower operators can read the pulses in a standardized code or align mirror arrays to forward messages.

They were invented in [[Stolmont]] in 24, as a development of a pre-Enchantment system involving shuttered lights. Since 78, the [[Starlight Phosgraph Union|starlight]] certifies and coordinates phosgraph operators internationally.

[[Roka]] is a leading firm in phosgraph operator training and tower repair.
