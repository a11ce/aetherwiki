The **Federative Union of Qamar** is a country in eastern [[Itaan]]. It borders [[Monnais]] to the north, [[Arkand]] to the south, and [[Delsin]] to the west. The Qamari part of the [[Irim Desert]] is the only location of naturally occuring emerald air. It is also known for The Qamar Historical Center in Cadaz.
