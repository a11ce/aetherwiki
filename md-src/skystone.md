**Skystone** is an iron-based alloy that hardens when exposed to compressed aether. It is the standard material used to make [[aether storage]] containers.

Laminated skystone was invented in 660 by Dr. Lucille Morin of [[Helix Dynamics]]. It allows for the construction of static pipelines, most famously by [[Northwind Rail]].
