Sovereigntism is a political position prioritizng national sovereignty over international governance. It is considered the opposition to federalism, especially in [[Pax Centralis]] countries, and was a partial motivation of the [[Lock 19 Blockade]].

[[Delsin]] is sometimes described as sovereigntist due to its lack of accession to [[IPRO]]. Sovereigntist partisans led the resistance against the Monnais Syndicate.
