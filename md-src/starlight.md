The **Starlight Phosgraph Union** is an international organization of public and private [[phosgraph]] operators.

Starlight certifies phosgraph operators, writes pulse code standards, and publishes indices of active phosgraph tower locations.

It was founded in 78 in [[Qamar]]. Current members include tower operators in Qamar and Monnais, the [[Ordossa Navigation Company]], the [[Whitewall Agency|ercos]], 12 [[kyros|Kota]], and over 100 [[Tilian|tilia]] frontier towns.

Since 520, Starlight hosts the Phosgraph Biennale every two years. It features social events, competitions, and exhibitions for phosgraph operators.

individual members of Starlight are fiercely independent and the only thing the organization itself does is coordinate them to work together effectively. messing with the freedom of phosgraphs will get you in trouble and is part of what led to the civil revolt in [[ikara]]
