The **Stratis Corporation** is a national syndicate of [[Arkand]]. It is responsible for urban and rural public infrastructure including transit.

Goran Feldt, an engineer working for Stratis, invented the [[triplex compressor]] in 346. The patent was later nationalized and transferred to the Finance Guild in 392 during the [[triplex crisis]].

In 446, Stratis hosted the Triplex Centennial Expo in [[Highwater]]. The Expo made no mention of the triplex crisis or patent seizure.
