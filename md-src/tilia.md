tilia is technically a constitutional monarchy and the king technically does have absolute power but is very careful not to overstep bc they will definitely get legislated away or killed. a lot of stuff is outsourced (like the military as [[coachguard]]). the frontier also does not have a lot of state capacity, like there's local sheriffs and sometimes Pax Marshals but thats about it. very wild west
