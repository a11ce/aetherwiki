A **triplex compressor** is a stationary, building-sized aethercompression pump. They were invented in 346 in [[Arkandic|arkand]] engineer Goran Feldt and became the standard depot compressor after the [[Triplex Crisis]] led to the nationalization of the patent.

They compress to [[blue-grade|aether density]] density.

an important thing here is that triplexes are not the first industrial compressors. theyre just like the size of a small windmill instead of requiring an entire factory. they also fill user-supplied canisters instead of barrels so theyre like a consumer-level infrastructure thing
