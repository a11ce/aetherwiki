The **Triplex Crisis** began in 392 A.E. when the [[Stratis Corporation]] suddenly increased the fees taken from the two largest [[Arkandic|Arkand]] cities to run their [[triplex compressors|triplex compressor]]. By this time, triplex compressors had become a vital part of Arkandic daily life, and the cities had little choice but to cut other services in order to keep them running.

This resulted in months of civil unrest until the Arkandic federal government forcefully claimed the patent and exiled Goran Feldt. Arkand later licensed the triplex compressor internationally.
