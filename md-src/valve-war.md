In 713 [[Arkand]] is economically not doing great because [[CRPs|CRP]] make [[skystone]] basically obsolete. Martime Syndicate decides to invade [[Lusquo]] and try to capture their seaweed farming market for export to Pax. They frame it as an enforcement action against unauthorized skystone production because Lusquo never formally joined [[IPRO]].

This does not work. The [[ONC|Ordossa Navigation Company]] sees it as a setup to block maritime access to [[Laumeri]] and immediately sends its security ships. ONC attempts to shell Arkandic occupying forces but doesn't want to risk civilian casualties and doesn't have the resources for a ground war.

An Ercosian export tanker en route to Delsin is sunk by an Arkandic torpedo 15 days after the initial invastion. 193 sailors are killed, mostly from Ercos and Kota. Ercos and Kota argue for Pax involvement. A week later, the Liaran delegation agrees that permanent Arkandic control of Lusquo would be unacceptable, thus authorizing Pax military involvement.

The naval war lasts 5 weeks after that and ends in an Ercos/Kota amphibious operation. Lusquo then joins pax as a protectorate and a naval base is established.

Arkand then turns to [[Delsin]] spies to get CRP tech, sparking the [[Ribbon War]] 22 years later.
