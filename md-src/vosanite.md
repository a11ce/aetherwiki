**Vosanite** is a mineral found in the western mountains of [[Kota]]. It was discovered in 362 as a green gemstone. In 364 it was noticed that vosanite 'leeches' into aethercompressed air under certain conditions.

In the 368, the Vosa research center was opened to explore the possibility of increasing [[aether density]] using vosanite. It was led by chemist Jinhai Luo, mechanical engineer Ki Wei, and mineralogist Dala Rafq.

Continuous production of what was then called Vosa 2 began in 372. A second refinery in nearby Qime was opened in 374.

The process was licensed to the [[Zalo Technical Kyro]] in 382, who built several refineries in the Vosa region.
