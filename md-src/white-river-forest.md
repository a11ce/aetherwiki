The **White River Forest** is a large temperate forest in southern [[Lanteen]] surrounding the White River. Apart from a few research stations in the [[Kotan|Kota]] side, it is uninhabited and considered too dangerous to traverse over land. Due to the difficulties of mapping the White River, the forest itself is considered a de facto border between Kota and [[Ikara]]. The White River Forest is home to many beasts, including [[Claw Beasts|claw beast]].
