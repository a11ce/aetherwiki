The **Wizard Revolution** was a period of unrest and political change lasting from 44 to 52 in [[Monnais]].

It resulted in the overthrow of the Kingdom of Monnais and the establishment of the Monnais Republic. Initially, the constitution of the Monnais Republic mandated that Presidium delegates be practicing [[wizards|wizard]]. This requirement was abolished in 54.
